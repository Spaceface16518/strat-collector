# Halo Strat Collector Reddit Bot

A simple CLI app that gets posts from our subreddit. It transfers them to a database for our website, linked here.

We use Snoostorm and Snoowrap with Node as a reddit bot. Visit releases to get the most recent copy of the software. Keep in mind, anything with a version tag less than `v1.0.0` is not ready for usage. This repository is customized to our settings, but feel free to modify it to fit you needs.
