# Halo Strat Collector Reddit Bot

A simple CLI app that gets posts from our [subreddit](https://github.com/Spaceface16518/strat-collector/blob/master/README.md#some-links-may-not-work-yet-you-may-be-directed-here-if-you-click-on-a-link-that-does-not-work). It transfers them to a database for our website, linked [here](https://github.com/Spaceface16518/strat-collector/blob/master/README.md#some-links-may-not-work-yet-you-may-be-directed-here-if-you-click-on-a-link-that-does-not-work).

We use [Snoostorm](https://github.com/MayorMonty/Snoostorm) and [Snoowrap](https://not-an-aardvark.github.io/snoowrap/index.html) with Node as a reddit bot. Visit [releases](https://github.com/Spaceface16518/strat-collector/releases) to get the most recent copy of the software. Keep in mind, anything with a version tag less than `v1.0.0` is not ready for usage. This repository is customized to our settings, but feel free to modify it to fit you needs.

#### Some links may not work yet. You may be directed here if you click on a link that does not work.
